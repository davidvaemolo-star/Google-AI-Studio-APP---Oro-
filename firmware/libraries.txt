# Required Arduino Libraries for Oro Haptic Firmware

## Installation Instructions
Install these libraries via Arduino IDE Library Manager:
Tools → Manage Libraries... (or Ctrl+Shift+I)

## IMPORTANT: Board Support Package MUST BE INSTALLED FIRST

Seeed nRF52 Boards
- Installation:
  1. File → Preferences
  2. Add to "Additional Board Manager URLs":
     https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json
  3. Tools → Board → Boards Manager
  4. Search "Seeed nRF52"
  5. Install "Seeed nRF52 Boards" package (v1.1.8 or newer)
  6. Select: Tools → Board → Seeed nRF52 Boards → Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense

## Required Libraries

1. Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 Libraries (INCLUDED with Seeed nRF52 Boards)
   - Library: bluefruit.h
   - NO SEPARATE INSTALLATION NEEDED
   - Automatically included when Seeed nRF52 board package is installed
   - Description: Native BLE library for nRF52840
   - NOTE: DO NOT install ArduinoBLE - it is incompatible with nRF52 architecture

2. Adafruit DRV2605 Library
   - Author: Adafruit
   - Version: 1.2.2 or newer
   - Description: Driver for DRV2605L haptic motor controller
   - Install: Search "Adafruit DRV2605" → Install
   - Dependencies: Will auto-install Adafruit BusIO

3. Wire (Built-in)
   - No installation needed
   - Built into Arduino core
   - Used for I2C communication

## Verification

After installation, verify libraries are present:
Sketch → Include Library → Should see:
  - Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 Libraries (or simply include <bluefruit.h>)
  - Adafruit DRV2605 Library
  - Wire (under built-in libraries)

If sketch compiles without errors, all libraries are correctly installed.

## Version Compatibility

Tested with:
- Arduino IDE: 2.3.2
- Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52: Included with Seeed nRF52 Boards v1.1.8
- Adafruit DRV2605: 1.2.2
- Seeed nRF52 Boards: 1.1.8

Newer versions should work, but if you encounter issues, use these exact versions.

## Troubleshooting

### "bluefruit.h: No such file or directory"
- Seeed nRF52 board package not installed or wrong board selected
- Solution: Install "Seeed nRF52 Boards" package and select XIAO nRF52840 Sense board

### "ArduinoBLE library incompatible with nRF52 architecture"
- ArduinoBLE library is installed (should NOT be used for nRF52)
- Solution: Uninstall ArduinoBLE library, use bluefruit.h instead (included with board package)

### "Adafruit_DRV2605.h: No such file or directory"
- Library not installed
- Solution: Install "Adafruit DRV2605 Library" via Library Manager

### Compilation errors about BLE functions
- Wrong board selected
- Solution: Ensure "Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense" is selected in Tools → Board → Seeed nRF52 Boards

### Upload fails "No DFU capable USB device available"
- Board not in bootloader mode or wrong port
- Solution:
  1. Press RESET button twice quickly to enter bootloader
  2. Select correct COM port in Tools → Port
  3. Try upload again
